# springboot
Create H2 based REST API with scheduler
 Write a middleware application:
 -create a spring boot application that serves as a middleware microservices for TODO list 
 -the rest API should cover all CRUD operation for TODO records
 -be able to run the application as a JAR package
 -build code using Maven
 -persist TODO dataset ( Imagine and define a table yourself for TODO record to be captured) in H2 DB or any other of your choice
 -use any Spring ORM or JDBC packages for data persistence
 -build should be able to create Swagger Rest API Docs
  
  
 For Bonus Points:
 •    Write a schedule job to send email on UNCOMPLETE TODOs within the application using Spring Scheduler or Spring/Quartz
 •    Protect Rest APIs with any of spring security options or with external providers like Okta or Auth0 (using OAuth or OIDC )
 •    Write Unit test that can be run with maven
